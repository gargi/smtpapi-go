# How To Edit the SendGrid Docs via GitHub

Contributing to [SendGrid's](https://sendgrid.com) [X-SMTPAPI](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/index.html) is easy!  
If you see an error, a typo, or have something you would like to add, you can file an [issue](https://github.com/sendgrid/smtpapi-go/issues) and open a PR for it. If you see an issue in the queue that you'd like to work on, please just post a comment saying that you want to work on it.

2. Once you are viewing the repository, click the **Fork** button (top right corner) to create a new fork. Doing so will create a fork of the repository that you will be able to access from your profile.

3. Create a new topic branch in your fork, either by using the web interface or by [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your repository.

4. Once you have made your changes, if they have been made in your local machine, you will need to commit the changes and push them to GitHub.

5. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository) with a clear title and description against the master branch.
